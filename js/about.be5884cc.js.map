При установена разлика с декларираното тегло и размери Куриерът извършва претарифиране и Потребителят дължи цена за услугата, която съответства на реално установеното тарифно тегло на пратката съгласно действащата Тарифа на Куриера.\r\n                            </li>\r\n                            <li>\r\n                            Опаковката /външна и/или вътрешна, в това число уплътнения, стиропор, бабъл фолио, други./ и затварянето на пратките трябва да бъдат съобразени с обема, теглото и съдържанието им, така че да осигуряват тяхната годност за транспортиране, да осигуряват предпазването им от щети, както и да предпазват причиняването на вреди върху други пратки, транспортирани от Куриера. Осигуряването на подходяща и надежна опаковка и затваряне на пратката е задължение на Потребителя и е за негова сметка, независимо дали ще предпочете фирмена опаковка на Куриера или собствена такава. Куриерът не приема пратки с неподходяща опаковка, която може да застраши съдържанието на пратката или целостта на другите пратки, транспортирани от него. В случай, че след приемане на пратката се установи, че опаковката й е неподходяща, пратката може да бъде транспортирана само ако Потребителят даде изрично писмено съгласие за това и ако с това не се предвижда вреда.\r\n                            </li>\r\n                            <li>\r\n                            Куриерът си запазва правото на оперативна самостоятелност и лична преценка относно организирането, изпълнението и условията на приемането, обработката, пренасочването, транспортирането и доставката на пратките, използвайки маршрути, транспортни средства, разпределителни центрове или подизпълнители, според целесъобразност и доколкото това не води до заплащане на допълнителна цена от Потребителя или до нарушаване на условията на договора между страните.\r\n                            </li>\r\n                            <li>\r\n                            Пратките се доставят до офис на Куриера, посочен от подателя.\r\n                            </li>\r\n                            <li>\r\n                            Пратките се предават на лицето, посочено като получател, на негов родител или законен настойник, ако е малолетно, или на упълномощено от получателя или законния му представител лице. Това обстоятелство се отбелязва при предаването на пратката, в това число се регистрира в електронната система на Куриера и е видно за подателя. Лице, различно от получателя, може да получи пратка срещу подпис и представяне на документ зa самоличност, като трите му имена се вписват в служебните документи на Куриера.\r\n                            </li>\r\n                            <li>\r\n                            В случай, че получателят откаже да получи пратката, той удостоверява това обстоятелство, като го отбелязва в товарителницата и се подписва. Ако получателят откаже да направи това, отказът за получаване се удостоверява от служител в офис на Куриера.\r\n                            </li>\r\n                            <li>\r\n                            Когато Куриерът не може да предаде пратка поради това, че получателят отказва да я получи или да я заплати, получателят е починал, както и поради други обективни причини, Куриерът уведомява подателя и му връща пратката за негова сметка. Пратката се връща в 14 дневен срок от уведомлението, като подателят дължи заплащане на услугата в двете посоки. Куриерът не носи отговорност при отказ на подателя да получи обратно пратката и да заплати услугата, както и при невъзможност пратката да му бъде доставена по причините, посочени по-горе в тази точка.\r\n                            </li>\r\n                            <li>\r\n                            Пренасочване на пратка към адрес на друг офис се извършва след писмено разпореждане от страна на Потребителя /подател или получател/, същото се счита за заявена нова услуга и подлежи на отделно заплащане. За отделното заплащане потребителят се уведомява предварително, като с писменото разпореждане той дава съгласието си както за пренасочването на пратката, така и за допълнителното заплащане.\r\n                            </li>\r\n                            <li>\r\n                            Непотърсени пратки в срока и при условията, посочени в т.36 от настоящите Общи условия, се съхраняват от Куриера за срок от още 14 дни, след което стават собственост на Куриера.
